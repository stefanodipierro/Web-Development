Data Protocol

What does protocol mean in Crypto?
Protocols are basic sets of rules that allow data to be shared between computers. For cryptocurrencies, they establish the structure of the blockchain â€” the distributed database that allows digital money to be securely exchanged on the internet. ... Of course, protocols aren't exclusive to cryptocurrency.



WhitePaper Development

problem we intend to solve.

It is clear to all the blockchain community that we are shifting to a cashless society,
this shift is becoming now evident to all citizen of the world.
The cryptocurrency industry is based on a simple achievement: people should be fully in control of their finances.
While this seems obvious, the reality we are living in is far away from this ultimate goal.
### explain why ###
As the current day, almost all financial services are run by centralized bank institutions. Investments, use a bank to put their money into interest or dividend-making instruments in order to grow their wealth. The problems with financial services are increasingly becoming obvious to everyone: compounded costs due to middle men, slow transactions, delays for cross-border transactions, and inaccessibility to many sectors of the population.
This is because you usually need documents and huge capital to directly purchase an asset without the middleman!
Guess what? You do not need any of them to invest in FRX.
You will need a BlockChain wallet and a computer or mobile device.

We remind you that a Blockchain wallet as the ones mentioned above does not require any ID or middleman verification. This is the reason why we call it a Freedom Republic!

###talk shit about BTC/ETH ###

Bitcoin,is designed as a form of digital cash, as a store and exchange of value, however it does not bring any cumulative interest by itself.It brought of course huge speculative price increase for HODLERS and traders.Cumulative interests on Bitcoin are usually offered by centralized exchanges. Let's talk about Ethereum. The evolution to Ethereum and smart contracts has allowed for tremendous new functionalities to be built on top of a blockchain, yet this development has come at a cost. The concept of one global operating system for everything has created a system that requires a complex codebase for smart contracts, slow throughput, and difficulty around the governance of the system. This is usually paid in transaction fees ( paid in GAS tokens ), that discourage small money transfers, and small investors pay the price.

### reasons we chose BSC ###

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is a blockchain protocol ( sets of rules that allow data to be shared between computers) from Binance that runs in parallel with Binance Chain. Unlike Binance Chain, however, Binance Smart Chain powers smart contract functionality and boasts compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
Binance Smart Chain uses a consensus algorithm known as Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) where 21 validators stake BNB, the native token for the Binance ecosystem, to secure the network.
The validators are then rewarded with fees while avoiding the risk of double-spending.
Bottomline BSC provides faster and cheaper transactions than most blockchains.


The cryptocurrency industry is based on a simple premise: people should be fully in control of their finances. While it seems like a simple and obvious statement, the current systems are far from providing financial services that are truly under the control of the people who use them. The mission of FRX is to give people seamless access to decentralized financial services.
